## About

This repository contains the nordxdataspace indy ledger network management software and documentations. 

The indy based trust anchor was originally used by Data4Diabetes - Swedish Health Data Space pilot with diabetes data using a MyData Operator infrastructure, funded by Vinnova. Vinnova or the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems, is the Swedish government agency that administers state funding for research and development.

## Release status

The NordXDataspace is now live, with a live indy network with validator nodes. 
                                                                                                                                      |
